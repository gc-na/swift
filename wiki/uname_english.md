# [Linux] C Shell (csh) uname用法: Display system information

## Overview
The `uname` command is used to display system information in Unix-like operating systems. It provides details about the system's hardware, operating system, and kernel.

## Usage
The basic syntax of the `uname` command is as follows:

```
uname [options] [arguments]
```

## Common Options
- `-a`: Displays all available system information.
- `-s`: Shows the kernel name.
- `-n`: Displays the network node hostname.
- `-r`: Shows the kernel release.
- `-v`: Displays the kernel version.
- `-m`: Shows the machine hardware name.
- `-p`: Displays the processor type (if available).
- `-i`: Shows the hardware platform (if available).
- `-o`: Displays the operating system name.

## Common Examples
Here are some practical examples of using the `uname` command:

1. Display all system information:
   ```csh
   uname -a
   ```

2. Show the kernel name:
   ```csh
   uname -s
   ```

3. Display the network node hostname:
   ```csh
   uname -n
   ```

4. Show the kernel release:
   ```csh
   uname -r
   ```

5. Display the machine hardware name:
   ```csh
   uname -m
   ```

## Tips
- Use `uname -a` for a comprehensive overview of your system in one command.
- Combine `uname` with other commands using pipes to filter or format the output as needed.
