# [Linux] C Shell (csh) readonly用法: Prevent variable modification

## Overview
The `readonly` command in C Shell (csh) is used to mark variables as read-only, preventing them from being modified or unset during the shell session. This is particularly useful for ensuring that certain variables retain their values throughout the execution of scripts or commands.

## Usage
The basic syntax of the `readonly` command is as follows:

```csh
readonly [options] [arguments]
```

## Common Options
- `-p`: Display all readonly variables in the current shell environment.

## Common Examples

### Example 1: Making a Variable Read-Only
To create a variable and make it read-only, you can use the following commands:

```csh
set myVar = "Hello, World!"
readonly myVar
```

### Example 2: Attempting to Modify a Read-Only Variable
If you try to change a read-only variable, you will receive an error:

```csh
set myVar = "New Value"  # This will cause an error
```

### Example 3: Displaying Read-Only Variables
To see all the read-only variables in your current shell session, use:

```csh
readonly -p
```

## Tips
- Use `readonly` for variables that should remain constant throughout your script to avoid accidental changes.
- Always check your read-only variables with `readonly -p` if you are unsure which variables are protected.
- Remember that once a variable is marked as read-only, you cannot unset it or change its value in the current session.
