# [Linux] C Shell (csh) dirs Uso: Display directory stack

## Overview
The `dirs` command in C Shell (csh) is used to display the list of currently stored directories in the directory stack. This stack allows users to navigate between different directories easily, making it a handy tool for managing your working directories.

## Usage
The basic syntax of the `dirs` command is as follows:

```csh
dirs [options] [arguments]
```

## Common Options
- `-c`: Clear the directory stack.
- `-l`: Display the directory stack in a long format, showing the full path of each directory.
- `+n`: Display the nth directory in the stack, where n is the index of the directory.
- `-n`: Display the directory that is n positions from the top of the stack.

## Common Examples

1. **Display the current directory stack:**
   ```csh
   dirs
   ```

2. **Display the directory stack in long format:**
   ```csh
   dirs -l
   ```

3. **Show the second directory in the stack:**
   ```csh
   dirs +2
   ```

4. **Show the directory that is one position from the top:**
   ```csh
   dirs -1
   ```

5. **Clear the directory stack:**
   ```csh
   dirs -c
   ```

## Tips
- Use `pushd` and `popd` commands to manipulate the directory stack effectively, allowing you to switch between directories without losing your place.
- Regularly check your directory stack with `dirs` to keep track of where you are in your workflow.
- Remember that the indexing for directories in the stack starts from 0, so the top directory is `+0`.
