# [Unix] C Shell (csh) endif <Usage equivalent in English>: End conditional statements

## Overview
The `endif` command in C Shell (csh) is used to mark the end of an `if` conditional statement. It is essential for structuring conditional logic in shell scripts, ensuring that the shell knows where the conditional block concludes.

## Usage
The basic syntax of the `endif` command is straightforward, as it does not take any options or arguments. It simply serves as a terminator for an `if` block.

```csh
endif
```

## Common Options
The `endif` command does not have any options, as its sole purpose is to close an `if` statement.

## Common Examples

### Example 1: Basic If Statement
Hereâ€™s a simple example demonstrating the use of `endif` in a conditional statement.

```csh
set var = 10
if ($var > 5) then
    echo "Variable is greater than 5"
endif
```

### Example 2: If-Else Statement
In this example, `endif` is used to close an `if-else` structure.

```csh
set var = 3
if ($var > 5) then
    echo "Variable is greater than 5"
else
    echo "Variable is not greater than 5"
endif
```

### Example 3: Nested If Statements
You can also use `endif` in nested conditional statements.

```csh
set var = 7
if ($var > 5) then
    echo "Variable is greater than 5"
    if ($var > 10) then
        echo "Variable is greater than 10"
    endif
endif
```

## Tips
- Always ensure that every `if` statement has a corresponding `endif` to avoid syntax errors in your scripts.
- Indent your code properly to enhance readability, especially when using nested `if` statements.
- Use comments to explain complex conditional logic, making it easier for others (or yourself) to understand later.
