# [Unix] C Shell (csh) compctl用法: Command completion control

## Overview
The `compctl` command in C Shell (csh) is used to define and customize command-line completion behaviors for various commands. This allows users to specify how arguments and options are completed when typing commands in the shell.

## Usage
The basic syntax of the `compctl` command is as follows:

```csh
compctl [options] [arguments]
```

## Common Options
- `-d`: Define a new completion rule.
- `-e`: Specify an external command for completion.
- `-k`: Keep the current completion settings.
- `-r`: Remove a previously defined completion rule.
- `-s`: Set the completion to be case-sensitive.

## Common Examples
Here are some practical examples of using `compctl`:

1. **Basic Command Completion for `ls`:**
   ```csh
   compctl -d ls
   ```
   This sets up basic completion for the `ls` command.

2. **Custom Completion for a Script:**
   ```csh
   compctl -d myscript
   ```
   This allows completion for a script named `myscript`.

3. **Using an External Command for Completion:**
   ```csh
   compctl -e 'echo file1 file2 file3' mycommand
   ```
   This uses an external command to provide completion options for `mycommand`.

4. **Removing a Completion Rule:**
   ```csh
   compctl -r mycommand
   ```
   This removes the completion rule set for `mycommand`.

5. **Case-Sensitive Completion:**
   ```csh
   compctl -s mycommand
   ```
   This sets up case-sensitive completion for `mycommand`.

## Tips
- Always test your completion rules to ensure they work as expected.
- Use the `-k` option to keep existing settings when adding new rules.
- Consider using external commands for dynamic completion options based on the context.
- Document your custom completions for future reference, especially if you have many rules defined.
