# [Linux] C Shell (csh) mesg Uso: Control message reception

## Overview
The `mesg` command in C Shell (csh) is used to control whether other users can send messages to your terminal. It allows you to enable or disable the ability for others to write messages to your terminal session.

## Usage
The basic syntax of the `mesg` command is as follows:

```csh
mesg [options] [arguments]
```

## Common Options
- `y`: Allows other users to send messages to your terminal.
- `n`: Disables message reception from other users.
- `?`: Displays the current message status (whether it is enabled or disabled).

## Common Examples
To enable message reception from other users:

```csh
mesg y
```

To disable message reception:

```csh
mesg n
```

To check the current message status:

```csh
mesg ?
```

## Tips
- Use `mesg n` when you want to focus on your work without interruptions from message notifications.
- Remember to enable messages again with `mesg y` if you want to receive messages after a period of working without interruptions.
- Checking the message status with `mesg ?` can be helpful to ensure you are set up as you prefer before starting a session.
