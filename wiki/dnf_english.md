# [Linux] C Shell (csh) dnf用法: Package management command

## Overview
The `dnf` command is a package manager for RPM-based distributions, primarily used to install, update, and remove software packages. It is a successor to the `yum` command and provides improved performance and dependency resolution.

## Usage

```bash
dnf [options] [arguments]
```

## Common Options
- `install`: Installs a specified package.
- `remove`: Removes a specified package.
- `update`: Updates all installed packages to their latest versions.
- `search`: Searches for a package by name or description.
- `info`: Displays detailed information about a specified package.
- `list`: Lists all available packages or installed packages.

## Common Examples
Here are some practical examples of using the `dnf` command:

- **Install a package:**
  ```bash
  dnf install vim
  ```

- **Remove a package:**
  ```bash
  dnf remove vim
  ```

- **Update all installed packages:**
  ```bash
