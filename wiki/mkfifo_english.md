# [Linux] C Shell (csh) mkfifo: Create named pipes

## Overview
The `mkfifo` command in C Shell (csh) is used to create named pipes, also known as FIFOs (First In, First Out). Named pipes allow for inter-process communication, enabling different processes to communicate with each other by reading from and writing to the same pipe.

## Usage
The basic syntax of the `mkfifo` command is as follows:

```csh
mkfifo [options] [arguments]
```

## Common Options
- `-m` : Set the permissions for the FIFO. This option allows you to specify the mode (permissions) for the newly created FIFO.
  
## Common Examples

### Example 1: Create a simple named pipe
To create a named pipe called `mypipe`, you can use the following command:

```csh
mkfifo mypipe
```

### Example 2: Create a named pipe with specific permissions
To create a named pipe called `securepipe` with read and write permissions for the owner only, use:

```csh
mkfifo -m 600 securepipe
```

### Example 3: Using the named pipe in a command
You can use the named pipe to send and receive messages between processes. For example, in one terminal, you can write to the pipe:

```csh
echo "Hello, World!" > mypipe
```

And in another terminal, you can read from the pipe:

```csh
cat mypipe
```

## Tips
- Always ensure that the named pipe is created in a directory where you have the necessary permissions.
- Remember that reading from a named pipe will block until there is data available to read, so make sure to have a reader process ready before writing to the pipe.
- Use named pipes for simple inter-process communication to avoid the complexity of sockets or other IPC mechanisms.
