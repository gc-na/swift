# [Unix] C Shell (csh) end <Usage equivalent in English>: Exit the shell

## Overview
The `end` command in C Shell (csh) is used to terminate the current shell session. It effectively closes the shell and returns control to the parent process or terminal from which it was invoked.

## Usage
The basic syntax of the `end` command is straightforward. You can invoke it without any options or arguments.

```csh
end
```

## Common Options
The `end` command does not have any options. It is a simple command designed solely to exit the shell.

## Common Examples
Here are some practical examples of using the `end` command:

1. **Exiting the shell:**
   To exit the current shell session, simply type:
   ```csh
   end
   ```

2. **Exiting from a subshell:**
   If you are in a subshell and want to return to the parent shell, use:
   ```csh
   end
   ```

3. **Using `end` in scripts:**
   You can also use the `end` command in a C Shell script to terminate the script execution:
   ```csh
   #!/bin/csh
   echo "This script will now exit."
   end
   ```

## Tips
- Always ensure you save your work before using the `end` command, as it will close the shell and any unsaved changes will be lost.
- If you have multiple terminal sessions open, using `end` will only close the current session, not others.
- Consider using `exit` as an alternative to `end`, as it serves the same purpose and is often more commonly used in scripts.
