# [Linux] C Shell (csh) bunzip2用法: Decompress bzip2 files

## Overview
The `bunzip2` command is used to decompress files that have been compressed using the bzip2 compression algorithm. It is commonly used to reduce the size of files for storage or transfer, and `bunzip2` allows you to easily restore these files to their original state.

## Usage
The basic syntax of the `bunzip2` command is as follows:

```
bunzip2 [options] [arguments]
```

## Common Options
- `-k`: Keep the original compressed file after decompression.
- `-f`: Force decompression, even if the output file already exists.
- `-v`: Verbose mode, which provides detailed information about the decompression process.

## Common Examples
Here are some practical examples of using `bunzip2`:

1. **Decompress a single file:**
   ```csh
   bunzip2 file.bz2
   ```

2. **Decompress a file and keep the original:**
   ```csh
   bunzip2 -k file.bz2
   ```

3. **Force decompression of a file:**
   ```csh
   bunzip2 -f file.bz2
   ```

4. **Decompress multiple files at once:**
   ```csh
   bunzip2 file1.bz2 file2.bz2
   ```

5. **Verbose output during decompression:**
   ```csh
   bunzip2 -v file.bz2
   ```

## Tips
- Always check the available disk space before decompressing large files to avoid running out of space.
- Use the `-k` option if you want to keep the original compressed file for future use.
- If you encounter issues with existing files, the `-f` option can help you overwrite them safely.
