# [Unix] C Shell (csh) pr <Usage equivalent in English>: Format text for printing

## Overview
The `pr` command in C Shell (csh) is used to format text files for printing. It organizes text into a paginated format, making it easier to read when printed. This command can add headers, footers, and manage line widths, allowing for a clean presentation of text documents.

## Usage
The basic syntax of the `pr` command is as follows:

```csh
pr [options] [arguments]
```

## Common Options
- `-h <header>`: Specify a custom header for the output.
- `-f`: Suppress the output of the page form feed.
- `-l <number>`: Set the number of lines per page (default is 66).
- `-w <number>`: Set the output width in characters (default is 72).
- `-t`: Suppress the printing of the header and footer.

## Common Examples
Here are several practical examples of using the `pr` command:

1. **Basic Formatting of a Text File:**
   ```csh
   pr myfile.txt
   ```

2. **Custom Header:**
   ```csh
   pr -h "My Custom Header" myfile.txt
   ```

3. **Setting Lines Per Page:**
   ```csh
   pr -l 50 myfile.txt
   ```

4. **Suppressing Header and Footer:**
   ```csh
   pr -t myfile.txt
   ```

5. **Setting Output Width:**
   ```csh
   pr -w 80 myfile.txt
   ```

## Tips
- Use the `-h` option to add context to your printed documents, making them more informative.
- Adjust the line width and lines per page to fit your specific printing needs and paper size.
- Combine options for more customized output, such as setting both a header and a specific line width.
- Always preview your document with `pr` before printing to ensure it appears as expected.
