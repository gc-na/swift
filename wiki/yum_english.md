## Usage

```bash
yum [options] [arguments]
```

## Common Options
- `install`: Installs a specified package.
- `remove`: Uninstalls a specified package.
- `update`: Updates all packages or a specific package.
- `search`: Searches for a package in the repositories.
- `info`: Displays detailed information about a specified package.
- `list`: Lists all available or installed packages.

## Common Examples
Here are several practical examples of using the `yum` command:

1. **Installing a package:**
   ```bash
   yum install httpd
   ```

2. **Removing a package:**
   ```bash
   yum remove httpd
   ```

3. **Updating all installed packages:**
