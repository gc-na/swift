# Understanding `throws` in Swift: Error Handling Made Simple

## Synopsis
In Swift, the `throws` keyword is an essential feature for error handling, allowing functions to indicate that they can throw errors during execution. This mechanism enables developers to write robust, error-resilient code by managing unexpected runtime conditions effectively.

## Documentation
### Purpose
The `throws` keyword is used within a function or method signature to specify that the function can throw an error. When a function is declared with `throws`, it signifies that one or more types of errors can be thrown, which must be handled by the calling code.

### Usage
To define a function that throws an error, include the `throws` keyword in the function signature. Additionally, any function calling a `throws` function must handle the potential errors, either using `do-catch` blocks or propagating the error further up the call stack.

### Detailed Steps
1. **Declaring a Throws Function**: Use the `throws` keyword in the function declaration.
   ```swift
   func mightThrowError() throws {
       // Implementation that may throw an error
   }
   ```

2. **Throwing an Error**: Use the `throw` keyword to throw an error within the function.
   ```swift
   enum SampleError: Error {
       case someError
   }
   
   func mightThrowError() throws {
       throw SampleError.someError
   }
   ```

3. **Handling Errors**: Use a `do-catch` block to handle errors when calling a `throws` function.
   ```swift
   do {
       try mightThrowError()
   } catch {
       print("An error occurred: \(error)")
   }
   ```

## Examples

### Basic Usage Example
```swift
enum FileError: Error {
    case fileNotFound
    case unreadable
}

func readFile(at path: String) throws -> String {
    // Simulating a potential error
    guard path == "validPath" else {
        throw FileError.fileNotFound
    }
    return "File content"
}

do {
    let content = try readFile(at: "invalidPath")
    print(content)
} catch FileError.fileNotFound {
    print("Error: The file was not found.")
} catch {
    print("An unexpected error occurred: \(error)")
}
```

### Propagating Errors
If a `throws` function calls another `throws` function, it can propagate the error:
```swift
func processFile(at path: String) throws {
    let content = try readFile(at: path)
    print(content)
}

do {
    try processFile(at: "invalidPath")
} catch {
    print("Caught an error: \(error)")
}
```

## Explanation
### Common Pitfalls
- **Forgetting to Handle Errors**: Not using a `do-catch` block when calling a `throws` function will result in a compile-time error, as Swift enforces error handling.
- **Incorrect Error Types**: When throwing errors, ensure that the error conforms to the `Error` protocol. Custom error types should also be clearly defined to prevent ambiguity.
- **Catching Specific Errors**: It's often beneficial to catch specific errors before using a generic catch block. This allows for more precise error handling.

### Additional Notes
Using `throws` promotes cleaner and more maintainable code. It is a best practice to document the potential errors that a function may throw. This helps developers understand the function's behavior and handle errors appropriately.

## One Line Summary
The `throws` keyword in Swift is a powerful tool for error handling, enabling developers to write functions that can throw errors and require proper handling in calling code.
