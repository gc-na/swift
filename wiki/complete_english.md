# [Linux] C Shell (csh) complete usage: Complete command line arguments

## Overview
The `complete` command in C Shell (csh) is used to specify how command-line arguments should be completed automatically. This feature enhances the user experience by allowing for faster and more efficient command entry.

## Usage
The basic syntax of the `complete` command is as follows:

```csh
complete [options] [arguments]
```

## Common Options
- `-c`: Specifies the command for which you want to set completion.
- `-d`: Defines a list of directories for completion.
- `-f`: Allows completion of filenames.
- `-n`: Sets a condition for when the completion should occur.
- `-s`: Specifies a short option for the command.

## Common Examples
Here are some practical examples of how to use the `complete` command:

### Example 1: Basic Command Completion
To set up completion for a custom command called `mycmd`:

```csh
complete -c mycmd -f
```

### Example 2: Directory Completion
To enable completion for a command that requires directory paths:

```csh
complete -c mydircmd -d
```

### Example 3: Filename Completion
To allow filename completion for a command:

```csh
complete -c filecmd -f
```

### Example 4: Conditional Completion
To set up completion that only occurs when a specific condition is met:

```csh
complete -c mycmd -n '[[ $status == 0 ]]'
```

## Tips
- Always test your completion settings to ensure they work as expected.
- Use the `-n` option wisely to create context-sensitive completions.
- Consider combining options for more complex completion scenarios.
- Regularly review your completion settings to keep them relevant as your command usage evolves.
