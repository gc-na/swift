# [Unix] C Shell (csh) stty 用法: Configure terminal line settings

## Overview
The `stty` command in C Shell (csh) is used to change and print terminal line settings. It allows users to configure various aspects of the terminal interface, such as input and output settings, control characters, and more.

## Usage
The basic syntax of the `stty` command is as follows:

```csh
stty [options] [arguments]
```

## Common Options
- `-a`: Display all current settings.
- `-g`: Print the current settings in a form that can be reused as an argument.
- `erase <char>`: Set the erase character to `<char>`.
- `kill <char>`: Set the kill character to `<char>`.
- `intr <char>`: Set the interrupt character to `<char>`.
- `sane`: Restore terminal settings to a reasonable state.

## Common Examples

1. **Display current settings**:
   ```csh
   stty -a
   ```

2. **Set the erase character to backspace**:
   ```csh
   stty erase ^H
   ```

3. **Set the interrupt character to Ctrl+C**:
   ```csh
   stty intr ^C
   ```

4. **Set the kill character to Ctrl+U**:
   ```csh
   stty kill ^U
   ```

5. **Restore terminal to sane settings**:
   ```csh
   stty sane
   ```

## Tips
- Always check your current terminal settings with `stty -a` before making changes to avoid disrupting your workflow.
- Use `stty -g` to save your current settings before making modifications, allowing you to easily revert back if needed.
- When setting control characters, remember to use the caret (^) notation for special characters like Ctrl combinations.
