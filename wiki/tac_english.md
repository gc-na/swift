# [Linux] C Shell (csh) tac Uso: Reverse concatenate and display files

## Overview
The `tac` command in C Shell (csh) is used to concatenate and display files in reverse order. It reads the input files line by line and outputs them starting from the last line to the first, making it useful for viewing the most recent entries first.

## Usage
The basic syntax of the `tac` command is as follows:

```csh
tac [options] [arguments]
```

## Common Options
- `-b`: Treats blank lines as separate lines.
- `-s`: Specifies a delimiter other than a newline for separating lines.
- `-r`: Ignores any lines that do not match the specified regular expression.

## Common Examples
Here are some practical examples of using the `tac` command:

1. **Display a file in reverse order:**
   ```csh
   tac myfile.txt
   ```

2. **Reverse the contents of multiple files:**
   ```csh
   tac file1.txt file2.txt
   ```

3. **Reverse and treat blank lines as separate:**
   ```csh
   tac -b myfile.txt
   ```

4. **Using a custom delimiter:**
   ```csh
   tac -s ',' myfile.csv
   ```

5. **Reverse lines that match a regular expression:**
   ```csh
   tac -r 'pattern' myfile.txt
   ```

## Tips
- When working with large files, consider using `less` in combination with `tac` to navigate through the output easily.
- Use `tac` in scripts to quickly check the most recent log entries or file changes.
- Remember that `tac` does not modify the original files; it only displays the output in reverse order.
