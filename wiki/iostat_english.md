# [Linux] C Shell (csh) iostat Uso: Monitor system input/output device loading

## Overview
The `iostat` command is used to monitor system input/output device loading by observing the time devices are active and the amount of data being transferred. It helps in identifying performance issues related to disk I/O and can provide insights into the overall system performance.

## Usage
The basic syntax of the `iostat` command is as follows:

```shell
iostat [options] [arguments]
```

## Common Options
- `-c`: Display CPU usage statistics.
- `-d`: Show device utilization statistics.
- `-x`: Display extended statistics for devices.
- `-h`: Show human-readable output (e.g., in KB, MB).
- `interval`: Specify the time interval between reports.
- `count`: Specify the number of reports to generate.

## Common Examples
Here are some practical examples of using the `iostat` command:

1. **Basic I/O Statistics:**
   ```shell
   iostat
   ```

2. **Display CPU and Device Statistics:**
   ```shell
   iostat -c -d
   ```

3. **Extended Device Statistics:**
   ```shell
   iostat -x
   ```

4. **Human-Readable Output:**
   ```shell
   iostat -h
   ```

5. **Report Every 5 Seconds for 3 Times:**
   ```shell
   iostat 5 3
   ```

## Tips
- Use the `-x` option for more detailed insights into device performance, especially when troubleshooting.
- Combine `iostat` with other monitoring tools like `vmstat` and `mpstat` for a comprehensive view of system performance.
- Regularly monitor I/O statistics to identify trends and potential bottlenecks in your system.
