# [Linux] C Shell (csh) groups: Display user group memberships

## Overview
The `groups` command in C Shell (csh) is used to display the groups that a user belongs to. This is useful for understanding user permissions and access levels within a system.

## Usage
The basic syntax of the `groups` command is as follows:

```
groups [options] [arguments]
```

## Common Options
- `-a`: Display all groups the user is a member of, including supplementary groups.
- `username`: Specify a username to check the groups for that particular user instead of the current user.

## Common Examples

1. **Display groups for the current user:**
   ```csh
   groups
   ```

2. **Display groups for a specific user:**
   ```csh
   groups john
   ```

3. **Display all groups for the current user, including supplementary groups:**
   ```csh
   groups -a
   ```

4. **Display all groups for a specific user:**
   ```csh
   groups -a john
   ```

## Tips
- Use the `groups` command regularly to verify your group memberships, especially before performing actions that require specific permissions.
- If you are managing user accounts, checking group memberships can help you troubleshoot permission issues.
- Remember that group memberships can affect access to files and directories, so always ensure users have the appropriate group assignments.
