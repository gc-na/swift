# [Linux] C Shell (csh) rehash用法: Update command hash table

## Overview
The `rehash` command in C Shell (csh) is used to refresh the command hash table. This table stores the paths of executable commands to speed up command execution. When a new command is added to the system or an existing command is moved, running `rehash` ensures that the shell recognizes these changes.

## Usage
The basic syntax of the `rehash` command is straightforward. You can simply invoke it without any options or arguments.

```csh
rehash
```

## Common Options
The `rehash` command does not have any specific options. It is typically used without any arguments.

## Common Examples
Here are some practical examples of using the `rehash` command:

1. **Basic Rehashing**
   To refresh the command hash table after installing a new program:
   ```csh
   rehash
   ```

2. **After Moving a Command**
   If you move an executable to a different directory, run:
   ```csh
   mv /path/to/old/location/mycommand /path/to/new/location/mycommand
   rehash
   ```

3. **Using with New Shell Sessions**
   After starting a new shell session, you may want to ensure that all commands are up to date:
   ```csh
   rehash
   ```

## Tips
- Always run `rehash` after installing new software or moving command files to ensure the shell recognizes them.
- If you encounter a "command not found" error after installing a new program, it's a good idea to try `rehash`.
- You can check the current hash table by using the `alias` command, which can help you verify if the rehash was successful.
