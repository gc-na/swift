# [Linux] C Shell (csh) hostname Uso: Display or set the system's hostname

## Overview
The `hostname` command in C Shell (csh) is used to display or set the name of the current host system. The hostname is a label that identifies the device on a network, making it easier to communicate with other devices.

## Usage
The basic syntax of the `hostname` command is as follows:

```csh
hostname [options] [arguments]
```

## Common Options
- `-s`: Display only the short hostname (the part before the first dot).
- `-f`: Display the fully qualified domain name (FQDN).
- `-i`: Display the IP address associated with the hostname.

## Common Examples

1. **Display the current hostname:**
   ```csh
   hostname
   ```

2. **Display the short hostname:**
   ```csh
   hostname -s
   ```

3. **Display the fully qualified domain name:**
   ```csh
   hostname -f
   ```

4. **Set a new hostname:**
   ```csh
   hostname new-hostname
   ```

5. **Display the IP address of the hostname:**
   ```csh
   hostname -i
   ```

## Tips
- Always ensure you have the necessary permissions to change the hostname, as it may require superuser privileges.
- After changing the hostname, consider checking your network settings to ensure that the new hostname is correctly registered.
- Use the `hostname` command without options to quickly verify the current hostname before making any changes.
