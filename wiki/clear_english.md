# [Linux] C Shell (csh) clear uso: Clear the terminal screen

## Overview
The `clear` command is used in the C Shell (csh) to clear the terminal screen of all previous commands and outputs. This helps to create a clean workspace, making it easier to focus on the current task.

## Usage
The basic syntax of the `clear` command is as follows:

```csh
clear [options] [arguments]
```

## Common Options
- `-x`: This option clears the screen and also removes any scrollback buffer, ensuring that no previous output can be accessed.

## Common Examples
Here are some practical examples of using the `clear` command:

1. **Clear the terminal screen:**
   ```csh
   clear
   ```

2. **Clear the terminal screen and scrollback buffer:**
   ```csh
   clear -x
   ```

## Tips
- Use the `clear` command frequently to maintain a tidy terminal environment, especially during long sessions with multiple commands.
- You can create a keyboard shortcut for the `clear` command to quickly clear the screen without typing it out each time.
- If you want to clear the screen and run a command immediately after, you can combine commands using `&&`:
  ```csh
  clear && echo "Screen cleared!"
  ```
