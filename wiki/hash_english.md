# [Linux] C Shell (csh) hash 用法等价: Manage command hash table

## Overview
The `hash` command in C Shell (csh) is used to manage the hash table of commands. This table stores the locations of commands that have been executed, which can speed up command lookup times.

## Usage
The basic syntax of the `hash` command is as follows:

```
hash [options] [arguments]
```

## Common Options
- `-c` : Clear the hash table.
- `-r` : Reset the hash table, removing all entries.
- `-l` : List the current contents of the hash table.

## Common Examples

### Listing the Hash Table
To view the current contents of the hash table, you can use:
```csh
hash -l
```

### Clearing the Hash Table
If you want to clear all entries from the hash table, use:
```csh
hash -c
```

### Resetting the Hash Table
To reset the hash table and remove all entries, execute:
```csh
hash -r
```

### Adding a Command to the Hash Table
When you run a command, it is automatically added to the hash table. For example:
```csh
ls
```
After running this command, you can check the hash table with `hash -l` to see that `ls` has been added.

## Tips
- Use `hash -l` frequently to monitor which commands are cached in the hash table.
- Clearing the hash table can be useful if you have updated the location of a command and want to ensure the new path is used.
- Remember that the hash table is session-specific; it will not retain entries after you close the shell.
