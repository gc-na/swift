# [Linux] C Shell (csh) unxz用法: 解压缩.xz文件

## Overview
The `unxz` command is used to decompress files that have been compressed using the XZ compression algorithm. It is a straightforward utility that restores the original file from its compressed `.xz` format.

## Usage
The basic syntax of the `unxz` command is as follows:

```shell
unxz [options] [arguments]
```

## Common Options
- `-k`: Keep the original `.xz` file after decompression.
- `-v`: Verbose mode; displays the progress of the decompression.
- `-f`: Force decompression, even if the output file already exists.

## Common Examples
Here are some practical examples of using the `unxz` command:

1. **Decompress a single file:**
   ```shell
   unxz file.xz
   ```

2. **Decompress a file and keep the original:**
   ```shell
   unxz -k file.xz
   ```

3. **Decompress multiple files:**
   ```shell
   unxz file1.xz file2.xz file3.xz
   ```

4. **Force decompression of a file:**
   ```shell
   unxz -f file.xz
   ```

5. **Verbose output during decompression:**
   ```shell
   unxz -v file.xz
   ```

## Tips
- Always check the contents of the `.xz` file before decompressing, especially if you are unsure about the file's integrity.
- Use the `-k` option if you want to retain the original compressed file for future use.
- If you encounter issues with existing files, consider using the `-f` option to overwrite them.
