# Understanding the "internal" Access Modifier in Swift

## Synopsis
The `internal` access modifier in Swift controls the visibility of entities within a module. It is the default access level, allowing entities to be accessed anywhere within the same module but hidden from other modules.

## Documentation
In Swift, access control is a fundamental concept that determines how entities such as classes, structures, enumerations, properties, and methods can be accessed in code. The `internal` access modifier is one of the four access levels in Swift, which also include `open`, `public`, and `private`.

### Purpose
The primary purpose of the `internal` access level is to restrict access to entities within the same module while preventing access from outside modules. This is useful for encapsulating functionality that is not intended for public use, thus maintaining a clean and manageable codebase.

### Usage
To declare an entity as `internal`, you simply omit the access modifier, as `internal` is the default. However, you can explicitly state it for clarity:

```swift
internal class InternalClass {
    internal var internalProperty: String = "Hello"
    
    internal func internalMethod() {
        print(internalProperty)
    }
}
```

In the example above, `InternalClass`, `internalProperty`, and `internalMethod` are all accessible anywhere within the same module.

### Details
- **Default Behavior**: If no access modifier is specified, entities are treated as `internal`.
- **Module Definition**: A module can be a framework, library, or application target. Each module has its own scope.
- **Inter-module Limitations**: Entities marked as `internal` cannot be accessed from other modules, which helps in maintaining modular integrity.

## Examples
### Example 1: Basic Usage of Internal
```swift
// File: InternalEntity.swift
internal class InternalExample {
    func greet() {
        print("Hello from InternalExample!")
    }
}

// File: main.swift (same module)
let example = InternalExample()
example.greet()  // Output: Hello from InternalExample!
```

### Example 2: Attempting to Access Internal from Another Module
```swift
// File: InternalEntity.swift (Module A)
internal class InternalExample {
    func greet() {
        print("Hello from InternalExample!")
    }
}

// File: AnotherModule.swift (Module B - different module)
let example = InternalExample()  // Error: 'InternalExample' is internal and cannot be referenced from outside its defining module
```

## Explanation
### Common Pitfalls
- **Unintentional Accessibility**: Developers may forget that entities without an explicit access modifier are `internal`, leading to unintended exposure of sensitive functionality.
- **Misunderstanding Module Boundaries**: When working with multiple modules, itâ€™s crucial to understand that `internal` entities are not available outside their defining module. This can lead to compilation errors if not managed properly.

### Additional Notes
- For APIs that need to be shared across different modules, consider using `public` or `open` access modifiers instead.
- Use `internal` for helper classes and methods that are only relevant within a specific module context to prevent clutter in the public interface.

## One Line Summary
The `internal` access modifier in Swift restricts access to entities within the same module, providing encapsulation while maintaining a clean and organized code structure.
