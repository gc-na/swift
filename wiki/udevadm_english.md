# [Linux] C Shell (csh) udevadm uso: Manage device events and properties

## Overview
The `udevadm` command is a tool used to interact with the udev device manager in Linux. It allows users to manage device events, query device properties, and trigger actions based on device changes. This command is essential for system administrators who need to monitor and control device management on their systems.

## Usage
The basic syntax of the `udevadm` command is as follows:

```bash
udevadm [options] [arguments]
```

## Common Options
- `info`: Display information about a device.
- `trigger`: Trigger events for devices.
- `settle`: Wait for all udev events to be processed.
- `control`: Control the runtime behavior of the udev daemon.
- `monitor`: Monitor udev events in real-time.

## Common Examples
Here are some practical examples of using the `udevadm` command:

1. **Display device information**:
   To get detailed information about a specific device, use the `info` option along with the device path.
   ```bash
   udevadm info --query=all --name=/dev/sda
   ```

2. **Trigger udev events**:
   To manually trigger events for all devices, use the `trigger` option.
   ```bash
   udevadm trigger
   ```

3. **Wait for udev events to settle**:
   To ensure all udev events are processed before proceeding, use the `settle` option.
   ```bash
   udevadm settle
   ```

4. **Monitor real-time udev events**:
   To watch for udev events as they occur, use the `monitor` option.
   ```bash
   udevadm monitor
   ```

5. **Control the udev daemon**:
   To reload the udev rules without restarting the daemon, use the `control` option.
   ```bash
   udevadm control --reload-rules
   ```

## Tips
- Always check the device path before running commands to avoid unintended changes.
- Use the `--dry-run` option with commands when testing to see what would happen without making changes.
- Regularly monitor udev events during hardware changes to ensure proper device recognition and management.
