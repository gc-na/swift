# [Linux] C Shell (csh) wall <Usage equivalent in English>: Send messages to all logged-in users

## Overview
The `wall` command in C Shell (csh) is used to send a message to all users currently logged into the system. This can be useful for system administrators who need to communicate important information or alerts to all users at once.

## Usage
The basic syntax of the `wall` command is as follows:

```csh
wall [options] [arguments]
```

## Common Options
- `-n`: Suppresses the printing of the message to the terminal from which `wall` was invoked.
- `-f`: Reads the message from a file instead of standard input.

## Common Examples

1. **Sending a simple message:**
   ```csh
   wall "System maintenance will occur at 10 PM."
   ```

2. **Sending a message from a file:**
   ```csh
   wall -f /path/to/message.txt
   ```

3. **Suppressing output to your own terminal:**
   ```csh
   wall -n "Attention: The system will reboot in 5 minutes."
   ```

4. **Sending a multi-line message:**
   ```csh
   echo "Attention:\nPlease save your work.\nThe system will shut down in 10 minutes." | wall
   ```

## Tips
- Use `wall` judiciously to avoid spamming users with too many messages.
- Always inform users of critical system changes or maintenance to ensure they are prepared.
- Consider using `wall` during off-peak hours to minimize disruption.
