# [Linux] C Shell (csh) pushd Usage: Navigate directories easily

## Overview
The `pushd` command in C Shell (csh) is used to change the current directory while simultaneously saving the previous directory on a stack. This allows users to easily switch back to the previous directory using the `popd` command.

## Usage
The basic syntax of the `pushd` command is as follows:

```csh
pushd [options] [arguments]
```

## Common Options
- `+n`: Rotate the directory stack to the right by `n` positions.
- `-n`: Rotate the directory stack to the left by `n` positions.
- `-q`: Suppress the output of the directory stack after the operation.

## Common Examples

1. **Change to a directory and save the current one:**
   ```csh
   pushd /path/to/directory
   ```

2. **Switch to a directory using a relative path:**
   ```csh
   pushd ../another-directory
   ```

3. **Rotate to the second directory in the stack:**
   ```csh
   pushd +1
   ```

4. **Rotate to the previous directory in the stack:**
   ```csh
   pushd -1
   ```

5. **Suppress output while changing directories:**
   ```csh
   pushd -q /path/to/directory
   ```

## Tips
- Use `popd` to return to the previous directory saved in the stack.
- You can view the current directory stack by simply typing `dirs`.
- Remember that the directory stack is limited by the shell's configuration, so keep an eye on the number of directories you push onto the stack.
