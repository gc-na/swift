# [Linux] C Shell (csh) kill用法: Terminate processes

## Overview
The `kill` command in C Shell (csh) is used to send signals to processes, typically to terminate them. It allows users to manage running processes by specifying their process IDs (PIDs) or by using other identifiers.

## Usage
The basic syntax of the `kill` command is as follows:

```
kill [options] [arguments]
```

## Common Options
- `-l`: List all signal names.
- `-s SIGNAL`: Specify the signal to send (e.g., `TERM`, `KILL`).
- `-n NUMBER`: Send the signal specified by the signal number.

## Common Examples
Here are some practical examples of using the `kill` command:

1. **Terminate a process by PID:**
   ```csh
   kill 1234
   ```
   This command sends the default `TERM` signal to the process with PID 1234.

2. **Forcefully kill a process:**
   ```csh
   kill -9 1234
   ```
   This command sends the `KILL` signal to the process with PID 1234, forcing it to terminate immediately.

3. **Send a specific signal:**
   ```csh
   kill -s HUP 1234
   ```
   This command sends the `HUP` (hang up) signal to the process with PID 1234.

4. **List all available signals:**
   ```csh
   kill -l
   ```
   This command displays a list of all signal names that can be used with the `kill` command.

## Tips
- Always try to use the default `TERM` signal before resorting to `KILL`, as it allows processes to clean up resources.
- Use `ps` or `top` commands to find the PID of the process you want to terminate.
- Be cautious when killing processes, especially system processes, as it may lead to system instability.
