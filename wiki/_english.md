# [Unix] C Shell (csh) @ Usage: Execute arithmetic expressions

## Overview
The `@` command in C Shell (csh) is used to perform arithmetic operations and assign the result to a variable. It allows users to execute simple mathematical calculations directly in the shell environment.

## Usage
The basic syntax of the `@` command is as follows:

```csh
@ variable = expression
```

## Common Options
The `@` command does not have specific options, but it supports various arithmetic operators such as:
- `+` : Addition
- `-` : Subtraction
- `*` : Multiplication
- `/` : Division
- `%` : Modulus

## Common Examples

### Example 1: Basic Addition
```csh
@ sum = 5 + 3
echo $sum
```
This will output `8`, as it adds 5 and 3.

### Example 2: Subtraction
```csh
@ difference = 10 - 4
echo $difference
```
This will output `6`, subtracting 4 from 10.

### Example 3: Multiplication
```csh
@ product = 7 * 6
echo $product
```
This will output `42`, multiplying 7 by 6.

### Example 4: Division
```csh
@ quotient = 20 / 4
echo $quotient
```
This will output `5`, dividing 20 by 4.

### Example 5: Modulus
```csh
@ remainder = 10 % 3
echo $remainder
```
This will output `1`, showing the remainder of 10 divided by 3.

## Tips
- Always ensure that the variable you are assigning the result to is initialized before using it in calculations.
- Use parentheses to control the order of operations, just like in standard arithmetic.
- Remember that the `@` command only works with integer arithmetic; for floating-point operations, consider using other tools or languages.
