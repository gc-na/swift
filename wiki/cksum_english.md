# [Linux] C Shell (csh) cksum用法: Calculate file checksums

## Overview
The `cksum` command in C Shell (csh) is used to compute and display the checksum of a file along with its byte size. This is useful for verifying the integrity of files by comparing checksums.

## Usage
The basic syntax of the `cksum` command is as follows:

```
cksum [options] [arguments]
```

## Common Options
- `-a, --algorithm=ALGO`: Specify the checksum algorithm to use (e.g., MD5, SHA1).
- `-b, --binary`: Treat files as binary.
- `-h, --help`: Display help information about the command.
- `-v, --version`: Show version information of the command.

## Common Examples
Here are some practical examples of using the `cksum` command:

1. **Calculate checksum for a single file:**
   ```csh
   cksum myfile.txt
   ```

2. **Calculate checksum for multiple files:**
   ```csh
   cksum file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
   ```

3. **Use the binary option:**
   ```csh
   cksum -b mybinaryfile
   ```

4. **Display help information:**
   ```csh
   cksum --help
   ```

5. **Check checksums of files in a directory:**
   ```csh
   cksum *
   ```

## Tips
- Always verify the checksum of downloaded files to ensure they are not corrupted.
- When comparing checksums, ensure that the files being compared are identical in size and content.
- Use the `-a` option to specify a different algorithm if needed for enhanced security.
