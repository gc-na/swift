# Understanding Operators in Swift: A Comprehensive Guide

## Synopsis
Operators in Swift are symbols or keywords that perform operations on one or more operands. They are fundamental components of the language, enabling developers to create expressions that manipulate data and control flow.

## Documentation
Operators in Swift are categorized based on their functionality and the number of operands they require. The primary categories include:

1. **Arithmetic Operators**: These operators perform basic mathematical operations. Common examples include:
   - Addition (`+`)
   - Subtraction (`-`)
   - Multiplication (`*`)
   - Division (`/`)
   - Remainder (`%`)

2. **Comparison Operators**: Used to compare two values, these operators return a Boolean result. Examples include:
   - Equal to (`==`)
   - Not equal to (`!=`)
   - Greater than (`>`)
   - Less than (`<`)
   - Greater than or equal to (`>=`)
   - Less than or equal to (`<=`)

3. **Logical Operators**: These operators are used to combine or invert Boolean conditions. Examples include:
   - Logical NOT (`!`)
   - Logical AND (`&&`)
   - Logical OR (`||`)

4. **Assignment Operators**: These operators assign values to variables or constants. They include:
   - Simple assignment (`=`) 
   - Compound assignment (e.g., `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`)

5. **Bitwise Operators**: These operators perform operations at the bit level. Examples include:
   - Bitwise AND (`&`)
   - Bitwise OR (`|`)
   - Bitwise NOT (`~`)
   - Bitwise XOR (`^`)

6. **Nil-Coalescing Operator**: This operator allows for a default value in case the optional is `nil`. It is denoted by `??`.

7. **Ternary Conditional Operator**: A shorthand for if-else statements, it is represented as `condition ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse`.

Operators can be overloaded, allowing developers to define custom behavior for their types. This enhances the expressiveness of the language and provides flexibility in code design.

## Examples
Here are some basic usage examples of operators in Swift:

### Arithmetic Operators
```swift
let sum = 5 + 10         // sum is 15
let difference = 20 - 5  // difference is 15
let product = 4 * 3      // product is 12
let quotient = 20 / 4    // quotient is 5
let remainder = 15 % 4   // remainder is 3
```

### Comparison Operators
```swift
let isEqual = (5 == 5)          // isEqual is true
let isNotEqual = (5 != 10)      // isNotEqual is true
let isGreater = (10 > 5)        // isGreater is true
let isLess = (3 < 5)            // isLess is true
```

### Logical Operators
```swift
let isTrue = true
let isFalse = false
let logicalAnd = isTrue && isFalse  // logicalAnd is false
let logicalOr = isTrue || isFalse    // logicalOr is true
```

### Assignment Operators
```swift
var value = 10
value += 5  // value is now 15
```

### Nil-Coalescing Operator
```swift
var optionalValue: Int? = nil
let defaultValue = optionalValue ?? 5  // defaultValue is 5
```

### Ternary Conditional Operator
```swift
let age = 20
let canVote = age >= 18 ? "Yes" : "No"  // canVote is "Yes"
```

## Explanation
When using operators in Swift, it is essential to be aware of operator precedence, which determines the order in which operators are evaluated. For instance, multiplication and division have higher precedence than addition and subtraction. Parentheses can be used to alter the order of evaluation.

Another common pitfall is the misuse of the assignment operator (`=`) versus the equality operator (`==`). A common error occurs when a developer accidentally uses `=` in a conditional statement, leading to unintended assignments instead of comparisons.

It is also important to ensure that the operands used with operators are of compatible types. For instance, attempting to add a string and an integer will result in a compilation error.

## One Line Summary
Operators in Swift are symbols that allow developers to perform various operations on values, enhancing the expressiveness and functionality of the language.
