# [Linux] C Shell (csh) gzip用法: Compress files

## Overview
The `gzip` command is used to compress files in Unix-like operating systems. It reduces the size of files, making them easier to store and transfer. The compressed files typically have a `.gz` extension.

## Usage
The basic syntax of the `gzip` command is as follows:

```csh
gzip [options] [arguments]
```

## Common Options
- `-d` or `--decompress`: Decompress the specified file.
- `-k` or `--keep`: Keep the original file when compressing.
- `-v` or `--verbose`: Display the compression ratio and other details.
- `-r` or `--recursive`: Compress files in the specified directory and its subdirectories.

## Common Examples
Here are some practical examples of using the `gzip` command:

1. **Compress a single file:**
   ```csh
   gzip myfile.txt
   ```
   This command compresses `myfile.txt` and creates `myfile.txt.gz`.

2. **Decompress a file:**
   ```csh
   gzip -d myfile.txt.gz
   ```
   This command decompresses `myfile.txt.gz` back to `myfile.txt`.

3. **Compress a file while keeping the original:**
   ```csh
   gzip -k myfile.txt
   ```
   This command creates `myfile.txt.gz` but retains `myfile.txt`.

4. **Compress all `.txt` files in a directory:**
   ```csh
   gzip *.txt
   ```
   This command compresses all text files in the current directory.

5. **Compress files recursively in a directory:**
   ```csh
   gzip -r myfolder/
   ```
   This command compresses all files in `myfolder` and its subdirectories.

## Tips
- Always check the size of your files before and after compression to ensure the desired reduction.
- Use the `-v` option to see how much space you save after compression.
- Be cautious when using `gzip` on large files, as it may take some time to complete the compression process.
