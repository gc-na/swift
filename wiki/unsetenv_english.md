# [English] C Shell (csh) unsetenv Usage: Remove environment variables

## Overview
The `unsetenv` command in C Shell (csh) is used to remove environment variables from the current shell session. This can be useful for cleaning up the environment or preventing certain variables from affecting the execution of scripts or commands.

## Usage
The basic syntax of the `unsetenv` command is as follows:

```csh
unsetenv [variable_name]
```

## Common Options
The `unsetenv` command does not have any specific options. It simply requires the name of the environment variable you wish to remove.

## Common Examples

1. **Remove a single environment variable:**
   To remove an environment variable named `MY_VAR`, you would use:
   ```csh
   unsetenv MY_VAR
   ```

2. **Remove multiple environment variables:**
   You can also remove multiple variables in separate commands:
   ```csh
   unsetenv VAR1
   unsetenv VAR2
   ```

3. **Check if a variable is removed:**
   After using `unsetenv`, you can check if the variable is still set:
   ```csh
   echo $MY_VAR  # This should return nothing if MY_VAR was successfully removed.
   ```

## Tips
- Always double-check the variable names before using `unsetenv` to avoid accidentally removing important variables.
- You can use the `setenv` command to create or modify environment variables if you need to adjust them after using `unsetenv`.
- Consider using `printenv` to list all current environment variables before making changes, so you know what you are working with.
