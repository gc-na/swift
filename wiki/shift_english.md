# [Unix] C Shell (csh) shift 用法: Shift positional parameters

## Overview
The `shift` command in C Shell (csh) is used to shift the positional parameters to the left. This means that the value of `$1` is discarded, and the value of `$2` becomes `$1`, `$3` becomes `$2`, and so on. This is particularly useful in scripts where you want to process command-line arguments sequentially.

## Usage
The basic syntax of the `shift` command is as follows:

```csh
shift [n]
```

Where `n` is the number of positions to shift. If `n` is not specified, it defaults to 1.

## Common Options
- `n`: Specifies the number of positions to shift. If omitted, the default is 1.

## Common Examples

### Example 1: Basic Shift
```csh
set args = (one two three four)
echo $args
shift
echo $args
```
**Output:**
```
one two three four
two three four
```

### Example 2: Shift by Multiple Positions
```csh
set args = (apple banana cherry date)
echo $args
shift 2
echo $args
```
**Output:**
```
apple banana cherry date
cherry date
```

### Example 3: Using Shift in a Loop
```csh
set args = (first second third fourth)
while ($#args > 0)
    echo "Processing: $1"
    shift
end
```
**Output:**
```
Processing: first
Processing: second
Processing: third
Processing: fourth
```

## Tips
- Use `shift` when you need to process command-line arguments one by one in a script.
- Always check the number of positional parameters (`$#`) before shifting to avoid errors.
- Combine `shift` with loops for efficient argument processing in scripts.
