# [Unix] C Shell (csh) fmt 用法等价: Format text paragraphs

## Overview
The `fmt` command is used to format text paragraphs in a way that makes them easier to read. It adjusts the line length to fit within a specified width, ensuring that the text is neatly aligned and properly spaced.

## Usage
The basic syntax of the `fmt` command is as follows:

```csh
fmt [options] [arguments]
```

## Common Options
- `-w <width>`: Specify the maximum line width (default is 75 characters).
- `-s`: Suppress splitting of lines that are already shorter than the specified width.
- `-u`: Unjustified output; lines will not be aligned to the left or right.

## Common Examples

1. **Basic Formatting**
   Format a text file to the default width of 75 characters:
   ```csh
   fmt myfile.txt
   ```

2. **Custom Width**
   Format a text file with a custom line width of 50 characters:
   ```csh
   fmt -w 50 myfile.txt
   ```

3. **Suppress Splitting**
   Format a text file but do not split lines that are already shorter than the specified width:
   ```csh
   fmt -s myfile.txt
   ```

4. **Unjustified Output**
   Format a text file without justifying the output:
   ```csh
   fmt -u myfile.txt
   ```

## Tips
- Always check the formatted output to ensure it meets your readability needs.
- Use the `-w` option to adjust the line length based on the medium where the text will be displayed (e.g., print, web).
- Combine options for more control over the formatting process, such as using `-w` with `-s` to maintain certain line lengths while formatting.
