# Understanding the `repeat` Statement in Swift: A Comprehensive Guide

## Synopsis
The `repeat` statement in Swift is a control flow structure that executes a block of code at least once and continues executing it as long as a specified condition evaluates to `true`. This makes it ideal for scenarios where you want to ensure that a loop runs at least one time, regardless of the condition.

## Documentation
The `repeat` statement, often referred to as `repeat-while`, is a fundamental part of Swift's control flow. It allows developers to perform repeated execution of a block of code until a certain condition becomes false. The syntax for a `repeat` statement is as follows:

```swift
repeat {
    // Code to execute
} while condition
```

### Purpose
The primary purpose of the `repeat` statement is to facilitate scenarios where the code inside the loop must run before checking the condition. Unlike a `while` loop, which checks the condition before executing the block of code, `repeat` guarantees at least one execution.

### Usage
1. **Basic Structure**: The `repeat` statement consists of a block of code followed by a condition. The code inside the block executes first, and afterward, the condition is evaluated.
2. **Condition Evaluation**: If the condition evaluates to `true`, the block will execute again. If `false`, the loop will terminate.
3. **Variable Scope**: Variables defined within the `repeat` block are scoped to that block unless specified otherwise.

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic Usage
```swift
var count = 0
repeat {
    print("Count is \(count)")
    count += 1
} while count < 5
```
**Output:**
```
Count is 0
Count is 1
Count is 2
Count is 3
Count is 4
```

### Example 2: User Input Validation
```swift
var input: String
repeat {
    print("Please enter a number:")
    input = readLine() ?? ""
} while Int(input) == nil
print("You entered a valid number: \(input)")
```

## Explanation
### Common Pitfalls
- **Infinite Loops**: Be cautious of the condition that follows the `repeat` statement. If the condition never changes to `false`, the loop will run indefinitely.
- **Variable Initialization**: Ensure that any variables used in the condition are initialized before the `repeat` block begins execution.

### Additional Notes
- The `repeat` statement is particularly useful in user input scenarios where the user needs to be prompted until valid input is received.
- It is recommended to use `repeat` when you know the code will need to execute at least once, as opposed to a `while` loop where the condition is checked before execution.

## One Line Summary
The `repeat` statement in Swift allows for executing a block of code at least once, continuing until a specified condition evaluates to false.
