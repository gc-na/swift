# [Unix] C Shell (csh) tput用法: 控制终端的显示属性

## Overview
The `tput` command is used in the C Shell (csh) to initialize and manipulate terminal capabilities. It allows users to control various aspects of terminal behavior, such as text formatting, colors, and cursor movement, by interfacing with the terminal's capabilities database.

## Usage
The basic syntax of the `tput` command is as follows:

```csh
tput [options] [arguments]
```

## Common Options
- `clear`: Clears the terminal screen.
- `setaf [n]`: Sets the foreground color to the color represented by the number `n`.
- `setab [n]`: Sets the background color to the color represented by the number `n`.
- `cup [x] [y]`: Moves the cursor to the specified position (x, y) on the terminal.
- `bold`: Sets the text to bold formatting.
- `smso`: Starts standout mode (usually for highlighting text).
- `rmso`: Ends standout mode.

## Common Examples
Here are some practical examples of using the `tput` command:

### Clear the Terminal Screen
```csh
tput clear
```

### Set Foreground Color to Red
```csh
tput setaf 1
echo "This text is red."
```

### Set Background Color to Blue
```csh
tput setab 4
echo "This text has a blue background."
```

### Move Cursor to Row 5, Column 10
```csh
tput cup 5 10
echo "Cursor moved to (5, 10)."
```

### Use Bold Text
```csh
tput bold
echo "This text is bold."
tput sgr0  # Reset to normal text
```

### Highlight Text
```csh
tput smso
echo "This text is highlighted."
tput rmso  # Reset to normal text
```

## Tips
- Always reset terminal settings after making changes with `tput` using `tput sgr0` to avoid leaving the terminal in an unexpected state.
- Use `tput` in scripts to enhance the user interface by providing color and formatting, making output more readable.
- Check the terminal capabilities with `infocmp` to understand what options are available for your specific terminal type.
