# [Unix] C Shell (csh) endsw <Usage equivalent in English>: Control flow for conditional execution

## Overview
The `endsw` command in C Shell (csh) is used to mark the end of a switch statement. It is part of the control flow structure that allows users to execute different blocks of code based on the value of a variable or expression. The `endsw` command is essential for properly closing a switch statement, ensuring that the shell understands where the conditional logic concludes.

## Usage
The basic syntax of the `endsw` command is as follows:

```csh
endsw
```

It does not take any options or arguments directly; it simply serves as a terminator for the switch statement.

## Common Options
The `endsw` command does not have any options. It is solely used to indicate the end of a switch block.

## Common Examples

### Example 1: Basic Switch Statement
Here is a simple example of using `endsw` in a switch statement:

```csh
set var = "apple"
switch ($var)
    case "apple":
        echo "This is an apple."
        breaksw
    case "banana":
        echo "This is a banana."
        breaksw
    default:
        echo "Unknown fruit."
endsw
```

### Example 2: Using Multiple Cases
In this example, multiple cases are handled within the switch statement:

```csh
set day = "Monday"
switch ($day)
    case "Monday":
        echo "Start of the week."
        breaksw
    case "Friday":
        echo "End of the work week."
        breaksw
    case "Saturday":
    case "Sunday":
        echo "It's the weekend!"
        breaksw
    default:
        echo "Just another day."
endsw
```

### Example 3: Nested Switch Statements
You can also nest switch statements, with `endsw` marking the end of each:

```csh
set color = "red"
switch ($color)
    case "red":
        echo "Color is red."
        switch ($color)
            case "red":
                echo "It's a bright color."
            endsw
        breaksw
    case "blue":
        echo "Color is blue."
        breaksw
endsw
```

## Tips
- Always remember to use `endsw` to close your switch statements; failing to do so will result in syntax errors.
- Use `breaksw` to exit a case block after executing the desired commands.
- Keep your case labels clear and distinct to avoid confusion when reading your code.
- Consider using default cases to handle unexpected values gracefully.
