# [Linux] C Shell (csh) export Uso: Set environment variables

## Overview
The `export` command in C Shell (csh) is used to set environment variables that can be accessed by child processes. This allows you to define variables that affect the behavior of programs and scripts run in the shell.

## Usage
The basic syntax of the `export` command is as follows:

```csh
export [options] [arguments]
```

## Common Options
- `-n`: Unsets the export attribute for the specified variable, making it local to the current shell.
- `-p`: Displays all exported variables and their values.

## Common Examples

1. **Setting an Environment Variable**
   To set an environment variable called `MY_VAR` with the value `Hello World`:
   ```csh
   set MY_VAR = "Hello World"
   export MY_VAR
   ```

2. **Checking Exported Variables**
   To display all currently exported variables:
   ```csh
   export -p
   ```

3. **Unsetting an Exported Variable**
   To unset the export attribute for `MY_VAR`:
   ```csh
   export -n MY_VAR
   ```

4. **Using Exported Variables in Commands**
   After exporting a variable, you can use it in commands. For example:
   ```csh
   set MY_PATH = "/usr/local/bin"
   export MY_PATH
   echo $MY_PATH
   ```

## Tips
- Always remember to export a variable after setting it if you want it to be available in child processes.
- Use `export -p` to quickly check which variables are currently exported.
- Be cautious when unsetting variables, as it may affect scripts or programs that rely on them.
