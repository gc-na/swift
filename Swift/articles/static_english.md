# Understanding `static` in Swift: A Comprehensive Guide

## Synopsis
The `static` keyword in Swift is used to define type-level properties and methods, allowing for shared access across all instances of a type without requiring an instance to be created.

## Documentation
In Swift, the `static` keyword serves to declare properties and methods that belong to the type itself rather than to instances of that type. This means that they can be accessed without creating an instance of the class or structure. The `static` keyword can be applied to both classes and structures, and it plays a critical role in managing shared state and behavior in your code.

### Purpose
- To create properties and methods that are associated with the type rather than instances.
- To enable efficient access to shared data or functionality across instances.

### Usage
To declare a `static` property or method, simply prepend the `static` keyword to the declaration. For instance:

```swift
struct MyStruct {
    static var myStaticProperty = "Hello, World!"
    
    static func myStaticMethod() {
        print("This is a static method.")
    }
}
```

You can access the static property and method using the type name:

```swift
print(MyStruct.myStaticProperty) // Output: Hello, World!
MyStruct.myStaticMethod()        // Output: This is a static method.
```

### Additional Details
- In classes, you can also use `class` for methods that can be overridden by subclasses, while `static` methods cannot be overridden.
- Static properties can be mutable or immutable.
- Static properties are initialized once when the type is first accessed, which means they maintain their state throughout the lifetime of the application.

## Examples

### Example 1: Static Property
```swift
class Counter {
    static var totalCount = 0

    func increment() {
        Counter.totalCount += 1
    }
}

let counter1 = Counter()
let counter2 = Counter()
counter1.increment()
counter2.increment()
print(Counter.totalCount) // Output: 2
```

### Example 2: Static Method
```swift
struct Math {
    static func add(_ a: Int, _ b: Int) -> Int {
        return a + b
    }
}

let result = Math.add(5, 3)
print(result) // Output: 8
```

## Explanation
When using `static`, it is essential to keep in mind that:
- Static properties and methods are shared across all instances. Changing a static property from one instance affects all instances.
- Static methods are not tied to instance data, which means they cannot access instance properties directly.
- Misusing static properties for instance-specific data can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs.

Common pitfalls include:
- Forgetting to use the type name to access static members, which can lead to confusion.
- Overusing static properties, which can complicate state management and testing.

## One Line Summary
The `static` keyword in Swift defines type-level properties and methods that can be accessed without instantiating the type, enabling efficient shared behavior and data management.
