# Abstract

This is an open community that encompasses all knowledge related to IT‚Äîfrom fundamental theories to the latest technology trends.  
To bring future technologies such as **AI, autonomous driving, Mars exploration, and the Metaverse** to life, **IT** is the essential technology.

I've always had many questions:
> ‚ÄúWhat does this term mean?‚Äù  
> ‚ÄúHow should I choose my career path?‚Äù  
> ‚ÄúWhat if I make a mistake?‚Äù  
> ‚ÄúWho can I ask when I don‚Äôt understand something?‚Äù  
> ‚ÄúAnd what about investing, debugging, or research papers...?‚Äù

With a variety of concerns on my mind, I decided to create this website to share my journey and address your questions‚Äîultimately contributing to the semiconductor industry.  
My ultimate goal is to serve as a beacon of progress for the global semiconductor industry, sparking positive change for both my company and society at large.

# Author

Hi again, this is **Chase**.  

MBTI: ESTJ, Nationality: South Korea. And I like movies and traveling.  
Do you have any more questions?

To be honest, every time I sit down to write, a wave of apprehension hits me:
> ‚ÄúWhat if my writing isn‚Äôt good enough?‚Äù  
> ‚ÄúIs it really okay for me to share these thoughts?‚Äù

But no one starts off perfect, and once something is finished, it can help others‚Äîthat in itself is a success.

I am constantly learning and striving for continuous improvement.  
If you notice any shortcomings or areas for enhancement, please feel free to guide me with your warm feedback. üôè

# Conclusion

This blog is just a side project; my primary focus is on advancing the best interests of the company I work for.  
I share this valuable knowledge at no cost, but I hope that the benefits you receive from it are infinitely more valuable.
